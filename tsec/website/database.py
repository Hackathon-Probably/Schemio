modi_list = ['<h2>Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)</h2> <p>Hon’ble Prime Minister announced Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as the National Mission on Financial Inclusion in his Independence Day address on 15th August 2014, to ensure comprehensive financial inclusion of all the households in the country by providing universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic bank account to every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension facility. Under this, a person not having a savings account can open an account without the requirement of any minimum balance and, in case they self-certify that they do not have any of the officially valid documents required for opening a savings account, they may open a small account. Further, to expand the reach of banking services, all of over 6 lakh villages in the country were mapped into 1.59 lakh Sub Service Areas (SSAs), with each SSA typically comprising of 1,000 to 1,500 households, and in the 1.26 lakh SSAs that did not have a bank branch, Bank Mitras were deployed for branchless banking.</p> <p></p> <p>Thus, PMJDY offers unbanked persons easy access to banking services and awareness about financial products through financial literacy programmes. In addition, they receive a RuPay debit card, with inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh, and access to overdraft facility upon satisfactory operation of account or credit history of six months. Further, through Prime Minister’s Social Security Schemes, launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 9th May 2015, all eligible account holders can access through their bank accounts personal accident insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, life insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, and guaranteed minimum pension to subscribers under Atal Pension Yojana. </p> <p></p> <p>PMJDY was conceived as a bold, innovative and ambitious mission. Census 2011 estimated that out of 24.67 crore households in the country, 14.48 crore (58.7%) had access to banking services. In the first phase of the scheme, these households were targeted for inclusion through opening of a bank account within a year of launch of the scheme. The actual achievement, by 26th January 2015, was 12.55 crore. As on 29.3.2017, the number of accounts has grown to 28.17 crore. Further, in 2011, only 0.33 lakh SSAs had banking facility and through provision of Bank Mitras in 1.26 lakh branchless SSAs, banking services were extended throughout rural India. The inclusive aspect of this is evident from the fact that 16.87 crore (60%) of PMJDY accounts are in rural areas and 14.49 crore (over 51%) PMJDY account holders are women.</p> <p></p> <p>The deposit base of PMJDY accounts has expanded over time. As on 29.3.2017, the deposit balance in PMJDY accounts was Rs. 62,972 crore. The average deposit per account has more than doubled from Rs. 1,064 in March 2015 to Rs. 2,235 in March 2017.</p> <p></p> <p>The Bank Mitra network has also gained in strength and usage. The average number of transactions per Bank Mitra, on the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System operated by Bank Mitras, has risen by over eightyfold, from 52 transactions in 2014-15 to 4,291 transactions in 2016-17.</p> <p></p> <p>For more Information on<a href="https://www.pmjdy.gov.in/" target="_BLANK" title="External site that opens in a new window"> Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana click here</a><br /></p>','<h2>Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY)</h2><p>The PMJJBY is available to people in the age group of 18 to 50 years having a bank account who give their consent to join / enable auto-debit.

Subscribers would receive the guaranteed minimum monthly pension of  Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000 or Rs. 3,000 or Rs. 4,000 or Rs. 5,000 at the age of 60 years. Under APY, the monthly pension would be available to the subscriber, and after him to his spouse and after their death, the pension corpus, as accumulated at age 60 of the subscriber, would be returned to the nominee of the subscriber. The minimum pension would be guaranteed by the Government, i.e., if the accumulated corpus based on contributions earns a lower than estimated return on investment and is inadequate to provide the minimum guaranteed pension, the Central Government would fund such inadequacy. Alternatively, if the returns on investment are higher, the subscribers would get enhanced pensionary benefits.</p> <p>In the event of pre-mature death of the subscriber, Government has decided to give an option to the spouse of the subscriber to continue contributing to APY account of the subscriber, for the remaining vesting period, till the original subscriber would have attained the age of 60 years. The spouse of the subscriber shall be entitled to receive the same pension amount as that of the subscriber until the death of the spouse. After the death of both the subscriber and the spouse, the nominee of the subscriber shall be entitled to receive the pension wealth, as accumulated till age 60 of the subscriber. As on 31st March, 2017, a total of 48.54 lakh subscribers have been enrolled under APY with a total pension wealth of Rs. 1,756.48 crore.</p> <p>For more Information on<a href="http://jansuraksha.gov.in/" target="_BLANK" title="External site that opens in a new window"> Atal Pension Yojana click here</a><br /></p>','<h2>Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana</h2> <p>The scheme was launched on 8th April 2015.

A total of 62166 claims were registered under PMJJBY of which 59118 have been disbursed.</p> <p>For more Information on<a href="http://jansuraksha.gov.in/" target="_BLANK" title="External site that opens in a new window"> Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana click here</a><br /></p>'}, 994: {'Title': 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)', 'Description': 'Hon’ble Prime Minister announced Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as the National Mission on...', 'Link': 'https://www.pmjdy.gov.in/', 'docs': ['passport', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'birth certificate'], 'html': '<p>Hon’ble Prime Minister announced Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as the National Mission on Financial Inclusion in his Independence Day address on 15th August 2014, to ensure comprehensive financial inclusion of all the households in the country by providing universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic bank account to every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension facility. Under this, a person not having a savings account can open an account without the requirement of any minimum balance and, in case they self-certify that they do not have any of the officially valid documents required for opening a savings account, they may open a small account. Further, to expand the reach of banking services, all of over 6 lakh villages in the country were mapped into 1.59 lakh Sub Service Areas (SSAs), with each SSA typically comprising of 1,000 to 1,500 households, and in the 1.26 lakh SSAs that did not have a bank branch, Bank Mitras were deployed for branchless banking.</p> <p></p> <p>Thus, PMJDY offers unbanked persons easy access to banking services and awareness about financial products through financial literacy programmes. In addition, they receive a RuPay debit card, with inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh, and access to overdraft facility upon satisfactory operation of account or credit history of six months. Further, through Prime Minister’s Social Security Schemes, launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 9th May 2015, all eligible account holders can access through their bank accounts personal accident insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, life insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, and guaranteed minimum pension to subscribers under Atal Pension Yojana. </p> <p></p> <p>PMJDY was conceived as a bold, innovative and ambitious mission. Census 2011 estimated that out of 24.67 crore households in the country, 14.48 crore (58.7%) had access to banking services. In the first phase of the scheme, these households were targeted for inclusion through opening of a bank account within a year of launch of the scheme. The actual achievement, by 26th January 2015, was 12.55 crore. As on 29.3.2017, the number of accounts has grown to 28.17 crore. Further, in 2011, only 0.33 lakh SSAs had banking facility and through provision of Bank Mitras in 1.26 lakh branchless SSAs, banking services were extended throughout rural India. The inclusive aspect of this is evident from the fact that 16.87 crore (60%) of PMJDY accounts are in rural areas and 14.49 crore (over 51%) PMJDY account holders are women.</p> <p></p> <p>The deposit base of PMJDY accounts has expanded over time. As on 29.3.2017, the deposit balance in PMJDY accounts was Rs. 62,972 crore. The average deposit per account has more than doubled from Rs. 1,064 in March 2015 to Rs. 2,235 in March 2017.</p> <p></p> <p>The Bank Mitra network has also gained in strength and usage. The average number of transactions per Bank Mitra, on the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System operated by Bank Mitras, has risen by over eightyfold, from 52 transactions in 2014-15 to 4,291 transactions in 2016-17.</p> <p></p> <p>For more Information on<a href="https://www.pmjdy.gov.in/" target="_BLANK" title="External site that opens in a new window"> Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana click here</a><br /></p>'},1001: {'Title': 'Extra Mural Research Funding', 'Description': 'The Science and Engineering Research Board supports potential scientists for und...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/extra-mural-research-funding.html', 'docs': ['passport', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'birth certificate']}, 1002: {'Title': 'High Risk - High Reward Research', 'Description': 'The Science and Engineering Research Board aims at supporting proposals that are...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/High_Risk_High_Reward_Research.html', 'docs': ['passport', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'aadhar card']}, 1003: {'Title': 'Core Research Grant (Individual Centric)', 'Description': 'The Science and Engineering Research Board supporting ideas that address a well-...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/Industry-Relevant-RD.html', 'docs': ['passport', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'birth certificate']}, 1004: {'Title': 'Assistance to Professional Bodies & Semi...', 'Description': 'The Science and Engineering Research Board supports potential scientists for und...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/Assistance-to-Professional-Bodies-Seminars-Symposis.html', 'docs': ['university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'birth certificate', 'aadhar card']}, 1005: {'Title': 'Ayurvedic Biology Program', 'Description': 'The Science and Engineering Research Board supports  basic research employing mo...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/Ayurvedic-Biology-Program.html', 'docs': ['university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'birth certificate', 'aadhar card']}, 1006: {'Title': 'Technology Development Programme (TDP)', 'Description': 'The Science and Engineering Research Board supports potential scientists for und...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/Technology-Development-Programme-TDP.html', 'docs': ['passport', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'birth certificate']}, 1007: {'Title': 'Software Technology Park (STP) Scheme', 'Description': 'The STP Scheme is a 100% export oriented scheme providing statutory services', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/software-technology-park-scheme.html', 'docs': ['birth certificate', 'MSME certificate', 'university degree']}, 1008: {'Title': 'Multiplier Grants Scheme (MGS)', 'Description': 'MGS aims to encourage collaborative R&D between industry and academics/R&D', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/multiplier-grants-scheme.html', 'docs': ['passport', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate', 'aadhar card']}, 1009: {'Title': 'Support for International Patent Protect...', 'Description': 'The scheme aims to provide financial support to MSMEs and technology startup uni...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/support-for-international-patent-protection-in-electronics-information-technology.html', 'docs': ['pan card', 'matriculate certificate', 'ration card', 'MSME certificate']}, 1010: {'Title': 'Scheme to Support IPR Awareness Seminars...', 'Description': 'The scheme aims to support IPR awareness workshops/seminars for sensitizing and ...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/scheme-to-support-IPR-awareness-seminars-workshops-in-E-IT-sector.html', 'docs': ['pan card', 'university degree', 'matriculate certificate']}, 1011: {'Title': 'Modified Special Incentive Package Schem...', 'Description': 'The scheme provides capital subsidy of 20% in SEZ (25% in non-SEZ) for units eng...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/modified-special-incentive-package-scheme.html', 'docs': ['passport', 'matriculate certificate', 'aadhar card']}, 1012: {'Title': 'Electronic Development Fund (EDF) Policy', 'Description': 'This fund of funds aims to foster R&D and innovation in technology sectors like ...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/electronic-development-fund-policy.html', 'docs': ['aadhar card', 'birth certificate', 'matriculate certificate']}, 1013: {'Title': 'Performance & Credit Rating Scheme', 'Description': 'The scheme aims to create awareness about the strengths and weaknesses amongst t...', 'Links': '/content/sih/en/reources/government-schemes/performance-credit-rating-scheme.html', 'docs': ['MSME certificate']}, 1014: {'Title': 'Bank Credit Facilitation', 'Description': 'The schemes aims to meet the credit requirements of MSME units.
